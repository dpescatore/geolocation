# geolocation
This is a javascript demo application for geolocating client built for a talk at University of Sannio.

The project has the only goal of building a simple javascript client able to change layers, get data from layers, draw some features.

The solution is based on Bootstrap and OpenLayers.

In order to work with Bing maps you have to edit js/app.8.js file adding your own registered bing key.
